**Programming Assignment 3**
Angela Alaisa

Goal: When encountering an uncertain/unfamiliar query, have the system adapt to try and understand it rather than ask the user to adapt

How it works:
  - User enters in any query or question regarding the representative
  - The query is searched for multiple regular expressions. If a match is found, the corresponding data will be outputted to the terminal.
  - program loops until "quit", "Quit", or "q" is entered by the user
